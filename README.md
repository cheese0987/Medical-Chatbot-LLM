# MediBot – A Medical Chatbot Enhanced with LLMs and Knowledge Augmentation

MediBot is an AI-powered chatbot I developed to explain medical concepts in simple, patient-friendly language. Built using a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM), MediBot combines domain-specific training with real-time document retrieval to deliver safe, accurate, and empathetic answers to healthcare-related questions.

## Use Case: MediBot as a Patient & Provider Assistant

MediBot helps bridge the gap between complex medical information and everyday understanding.

It can:

* Simplify and clarify medical jargon for patients
* Assist healthcare professionals with fast lookups of conditions, symptoms, and treatments
* Provide general education on diagnoses, medications, and procedures in conversational format

MediBot is built with techniques like:

* Context injection with clinical and biomedical sources
* Fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets
* Prompt engineering for safety, tone, and accuracy

##  Knowledge Augmentation with LLMs

Out-of-the-box LLMs have broad language understanding but struggle with domain precision. In this project, I demonstrate how to adapt a general LLM to the healthcare domain using knowledge augmentation.

---

##  Overview

I enhanced the performance of a pre-trained **LLaMA 2–7B** model using techniques including:

* Supervised fine-tuning with 24,000+ biomedical Q\&A pairs
* Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via FAISS to inject trustworthy context
* Prompt engineering for empathetic and compliant responses

---

##  Key Techniques Used

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

I integrated external medical documents at inference time to ensure answers are grounded in real data and reduce hallucinations.

### 2. Fine-Tuning with Domain Data

I fine-tuned the base LLM using medical instruction–response pairs to teach it the language, logic, and tone of healthcare conversations.

### 3. Vector Search with FAISS

Medical documents were embedded into a vector store and indexed using FAISS. The most relevant chunks were retrieved dynamically and passed to the LLM as context.

### 4. Prompt Engineering

I used structured, role-based prompts and few-shot examples to ensure consistent, safe, and helpful dialogue.
